# VoiceMate Beta

VoiceMate interprets any online text into spoken word directly within your Chrome browser. 

Designed to enhance your browsing experience, VoiceMate allows you to listen to any web content with ease, turning text into speech with a simple click. 

You take control of where and when to listen. Download the audio file and take it with you while you commute, run, or workout.
